====== Testing Zookeepr ======

Tests should be written for functionality as it is ported from Pylons to Pyramid.

There are some old tests that don't run. If you want to salvage them into some new format that would be grand. Otherwise ignore them. New tests reside in `/zk/tests/models`.

Run tests with py.test (installed with `pip install pytest`). For example: `py.test zk/tests/model/ --tb=short -v`

====== Testing models ======
Models can be tested using `factory_boy`.

In `/zk/tests/models/factories.py` import your model class (Foo) and create a factory (FooFactory) for it. In your factory you only need to list attributes that you potentially want to change when instantiating.

Create a new file per model class, `test_foo.py`. Then import your factory and use it to create model instances to test the methods of.


====== Testing controllers ======
TBD. Selenium??
